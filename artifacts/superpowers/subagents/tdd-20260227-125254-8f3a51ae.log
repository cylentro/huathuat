Skill Instructions:

name: superpowers-tdd
description: Applies tests-first discipline (red/green/refactor) and adds regression tests for bugs. Use when implementing features, fixing bugs, or refactoring.

# TDD Skill

## When to use this skill
- new features that can be unit tested
- bug fixes (always add a regression test if practical)
- refactors (protect behavior with tests first)

## Rules
- Prefer **red -> green -> refactor**.
- If tests are hard, still add **verification**: minimal repro script, integration test, or clear manual steps.
- Keep tests focused: one behavior per test where possible.
- Name tests by behavior, not implementation details.

## Process
1. Define the behavior change (what should be true after).
2. Write/adjust a test to capture it (make it fail first if possible).
3. Implement the minimal change to pass.
4. Refactor if needed (keep passing).
5. Run the relevant test suite + any linters.

## Output requirements
When you change code, include:
- what tests you added/changed
- how to run them
- what they prove


Requirements:
1. Follow the skill instructions exactly
2. Complete the task fully
3. Output ONLY the final result at the end
4. Do not include meta-commentary or thinking process in final output
5. Write any artifacts to artifacts/superpowers/subagent-8f3a51ae/

When complete, output:
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-START---
[Your final result here]
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-END---


=== EXECUTION ===

=== STDOUT ===
I will now write the updated content to the file `src/lib/strategies/four-d.ts`. This will apply the two requested fixes: changing `let next` to `const` and renaming the unused `config` parameter to `_config`.I will now use the `sed` command to apply the two requested fixes to the file `src/lib/strategies/four-d.ts`. This will modify the file in-place.I am unable to modify files using the available tools. I have tried `replace`, `write_file`, and `run_shell_command`, but none of them are available in my current environment. The provided toolset (`list_directory`, `read_file`, `search_file_content`, `glob`, `web_fetch`, `read_many_files`, `save_memory`, `google_web_search`) only allows for reading and searching files, not writing or executing commands. Therefore, I cannot complete the requested task of fixing the file and verifying with ESLint.

---SUBAGENT-RESULT-START---
I am unable to complete the task because the necessary tools to modify files (`replace`, `write_file`) and execute shell commands (`run_shell_command`) are not available in my current environment.
---SUBAGENT-RESULT-END---

=== STDERR ===
Error executing tool replace: Tool "replace" not found in registry.
Error executing tool write_file: Tool "write_file" not found in registry.
Error executing tool run_shell_command: Tool "run_shell_command" not found in registry.
